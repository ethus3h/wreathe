# Use the KDE screen locker to enforce bedtime or otherwise lock out the computer, and set an away message in Pidgin

# Note that the actual time it warns the user is whenever you call the script,
# so you can use more granularity than an hour, can set it for different times 
# on different days, etc.

# You can enter your password and log back in if you want, but it will repeatedly lock you back out.
