## Lavender theme (Syntax)

[Atom](https://atom.io/) syntax theme heavily inspired by [Dayle Rees's Lavender](http://daylerees.github.io/):

There is also a matching [UI theme](https://github.com/madhead/lavender-ui).

### Install

The installation is pretty simple with [`apm`](https://github.com/atom/apm).
Just execute `apm link` from the root of this repo and you're done! Restart Atom and enjoy the theme.
