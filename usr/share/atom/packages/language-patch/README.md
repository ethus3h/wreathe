## Syntax highlighting for patch files in Atom

This Atom package intends to provide simplistic syntax-highlighting in patch
files generated by various version control softwares.

## Features
* Highlighting of additions and removals within a file.
* Highlighting of comments in the file.

## Addendum
Honestly, this package is somewhat redundant. The language-diff package performs
 the same functions as this and uses the TextMate syntax definitions, so is
likely more flexible overall. This is just a small toy of mine that happens to
have some functional purpose.
