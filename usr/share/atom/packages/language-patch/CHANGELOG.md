## 1.0.1
* Change to syntax scopes to both support more syntax themes and generally
make more sense.
* Minor improvement to regexp used for syntax highlight. Less duplication!

## 1.0 - Stable Release
* There are no new features in this change, patch is far too simple.

## 0.1.1 - Metadata changes
* In light of a clone appearing I finally remembered I have this project, the
metadata for the plugin has been updated to identify me as the author of this
version

## 0.1.0 - First Release
* Every feature added
* Every bug fixed
