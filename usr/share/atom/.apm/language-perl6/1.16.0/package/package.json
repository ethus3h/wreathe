See\n[here](#how-do-i-use-this) for questions about usage.\n\n![A screenshot of an funnified Perl 6 file][screenshot-1]\n\n## Integration\nThis package has integration with the Atom [script][script-package] package.\nWith both this package and the `script` package you can execute\nhighlighted Perl 6 code or the whole document, even if it hasn't been saved using\na keyboard shortcut.\n\n## What Makes This The *Fun* Edition?\n\n> Perl 6 is optimized for fun. ― Audrey Tang\n\n* This package was designed to work with [Fira Code][fira-code] ligatures\n\n* Much more syntax highlighted (numbers, operators, interpolation, traits, better strings).\n\n* Some day we hope this package will also contain support for many popular\n  atom packages that have service hooks like autocomplete+ and linter\n\n\n## See something? Say something!\nSee something highlighted incorrectly? See something LTA (Less Than Awesome)?\nPlease report it on the [issue tracker][issues]. Any issue no matter how small\nshould be reported. It is our hope that this is not only the best Perl 6\nhighlighter for Atom, but the best highlighter for Atom out there.\n\n## Contributing\nContributions are welcome! Please see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`][contributing] for a tutorial on writing Atom syntax grammars and more information!\n\n## Potential Future Features\nIntegration with Autocomplete+, linter or other packages are possible future features. See [Contributing](#contributing) if you want to help!\n\n## How do I use this?\n\nThis language grammar should automatically highlight `.p6`, `.pod6`, `.pm6` and\n`.nqp` files. The language grammar will also detect files whose first\nline includes `use v6`, a shebang whose last term before any whitespace is\n`perl6` , `=begin pod`, or `my class`.\n\nIf you are having issues, the `language-perl` package is probably taking\nprecedence. To remedy this you can:\n\n* Click the language name in the status-bar (`Ctrl+Shift+L`) and select `Perl 6 FE`\n* If you want to permanently change the preferences for a file type,\n  add the following to your `config.cson` (*Edit* → *Config*):\n\n  ```coffee\n  \"*\":\n    core:\n      customFileTypes:\n        'source.perl6fe': [\n          'p6'\n          'pm6'\n          # Add pm and t if you want auto choose this highlighter for .pm or 't\n          # files.\n          'pm'\n          't'\n        ]\n  ```\n\nPlease be aware that if you do not include the `t` extension\nabove, your `t` files will be highlighted with the `language-perl` highlighter unless the first line contains `use v6;`.\n\n# License\n\n[MIT][mit] © All [contributors][CREDITS]","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"language-perl6@1.16.0","_shasum":"2c2e24c253887e3c56c6e44722c7def2e47cb259","_resolved":"file:../d-117822-30811-1anycqn.ff0rafw29/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117822-30811-1anycqn.ff0rafw29/package.tgz"}
