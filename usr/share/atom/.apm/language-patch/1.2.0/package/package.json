The language-diff package performs\n the same functions as this and uses the TextMate syntax definitions, so is\nlikely more flexible overall. This is just a small toy of mine that happens to\nhave some functional purpose.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"language-patch@1.2.0","_shasum":"9332a57cf6a443e37929b7c2075c254409235834","_resolved":"file:../d-116720-7519-pbraie/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116720-7519-pbraie/package.tgz"}
