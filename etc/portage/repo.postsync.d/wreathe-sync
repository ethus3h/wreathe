# With portage-2.2.16 and newer, all repo.postsync.d hooks will be called multiple
# times after syncing each repository.
#
# Older versions of Portage support syncing only one repository.
# In those versions, the postsync.d hooks will be called only once,
# and they will not be passed any parameters.

# On a repo.postsync.d hook call, positional parameters contain
# information about the just-synced repository.

# Your hook can control it's actions depending on any of the three
# parameters passed in to it.
#
# They are as follows:
#
# The repository name.
repository_name=${1}
# The URI to which the repository was synced.
sync_uri=${2}
# The path to the repository.
repository_path=${3}

# Portage assumes that a hook succeeded if it exits with 0 code. If no
# explicit exit is done, the exit code is the exit code of last spawned
# command. Since our script is a bit more complex, we want to control
# the exit code explicitly.
